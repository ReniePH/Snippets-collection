Make sure you have Node.JS installed and node and npm are available in your path.
Create a directory rest-service-node and cd into it:

mkdir rest-service-node
cd rest-service-node

Initialize the node project:

npm init -y

The -y flag skips all the questions. 
Let's install some packages. We will be using the ExpressJS framework for developing the REST Server. 

npm install --save express body-parser

What's body-parser there for? Express, by default, is incapable of handling data sent via POST request as JSON. body-parser allows Express to overcome this.
Create a file called server.js

const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.listen(5000, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port 5000.`);
});

The first two lines are importing Express and body-parser.
Third line initializes the Express server and sets it to a variable called app.
The line, app.use(bodyParser.json()); initializes the body-parser plugin.
Finally, we are setting our server to listen on port 5000 for requests.

Getting data from the REST Server:
To get data from a server, we need a GET request. Add the following code before app.listen:

const sayHi = (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hi!");
};

app.get("/", sayHi);

node server.js

If everything is successful, you should see a message on console saying: Server is running on port 5000.

Sending data to REST Server:
As we have discussed earlier, let's setup how we can implement a POST request into our server.
We will be sending in two numbers and the server will return the sum of the numbers. Add this new method below the app.get :

app.post("/add", (req, res) => {
  const { a, b } = req.body;
  res.send(`The sum is: ${a + b}`);
});

Here, we will be sending the data in JSON format, like this:

{
    "a":5,
    "b":10
}
